# Programmable-Digital-Synthesizers
This repository hosts the source code for creating simple and expandable digital synthesizers, by using an arduino as an input device, and PureData as an Audio - Synthesis Environment.

**MONK** is a Programmable Digital Synthesizer, made from scratch using Arduino and PureData. The Arduino acts as an input device, reading the values of six potentiometers and transfering the values through USB to a computer that runs PureData. Inside PureData, these values are passed to parameters that control sound, so the whole setup turns into a musical instrument. You may programme your own patches to completely change the MONKâ€™s audio function, or even use it as a controller for other purposes (for example graphics)
