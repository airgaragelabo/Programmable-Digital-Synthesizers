# Programmable-Digital-Synthesizers
This repository hosts the source code for creating simple and expandable digital synthesizers, by using an arduino as an input device, and PureData as an Audio - Synthesis Environment. 

## 1. Monk
The **Monk** is a very simple instrument.  
It consists of one **Arduino Uno** and six potentiometers.  
The Arduino reads the values of the potentiometers and sends them to PureData via a serial connection over the USB cable.  
The values of the six potentiometers can be used to control your own patch.  
You may also use one of the offered examples.  

## 2. HarmonizR
coming soon!
